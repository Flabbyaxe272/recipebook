__Description__:
This came about because my parents liked to make breakfast burritos a lot. My dad loved to cook while camping and it just became a thing. He doesn't do recipes so my Mom had to write out an idea of what he uses. Adjust to your liking accordingly. It's never made the same twice.

### Ingredients
- 1 lb breakfast Sausage^[Original recipie calls for Jimmy Dean brand]
- 1 lb shredded hashbrowns
- 1 lb bacon 
3. Add shredded cheese and salt and pepper to taste.

[^footnotes]: While the original recipe says XX minutes, we need to adjust due to altitude. The recipe was created in Texas, closer to sea level at 630'. At the time of this writing, we're at 4,705', so a little higher :)
