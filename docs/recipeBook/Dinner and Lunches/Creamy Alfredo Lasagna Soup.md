### Instructions:
1. **Cook the Meat**: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground chicken or Italian sausage and cook until browned, breaking it into small pieces with a spatula. Drain excess fat if needed.
2. **Sauté Aromatics**: Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the pot with the cooked meat. Sauté for 3–4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant.
3. **Add Broth and Sauces**: Pour in the chicken broth, heavy cream, and marinara sauce, stirring well to combine. Add the Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil.
4. **Cook the Noodles**: Add the broken lasagna noodles to the pot, making sure they are submerged in the liquid. Simmer for 10–12 minutes, or until the noodles are tender.
5. **Add Cheese**: Reduce the heat to low. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted and creamy. Add the shredded mozzarella cheese and stir until smooth.
6. **Serve**: Ladle the soup into individual bowls. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley for extra flavor and a touch of color. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes for a hint of spice if desired. Serve hot and enjoy!
