__Description__: This came about because my parents liked to make breakfast burritos a lot. My dad loved to cook while camping and it just became a thing. He doesn't write recipes so my Mom had to write out an idea of what he uses. I've adjusted according to how I remember it. Adjust to your liking accordingly. It's never made the same twice.
