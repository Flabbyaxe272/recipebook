# Sausage Saute

__Original Source__: Wassom Cookbook

__Servings per Recipe__: 6 servings

__Description__: One of Dad Wassom favorites! A pasta dish that involves sausage, onion, and zucchini and various spices. I've also revamped the recipe a little by adding additional spices to bring depth to the dish. Ingredients are different but the process is the same.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb bow tie pasta
- Olive oil
- 2 lbs smoked sausage[^sausage], sliced
- 1 Tbsp butter
- 2 medium zucchini
- &frac12; onion[^onion], diced
- 1 tsp garlic salt
- &frac12; tsp oregano
- &frac14; tsp pepper
- 1 can diced tomatoes[^tomatoes]

### Optional

- &frac12; tsp smoked paprika
- &frac12; tsp dried parsley
- 1 tsp red chili pepper flakes

***

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, prepare and make the bowtie pasta as directed on the box/bag until al dente. Drain and drizzle olive oil over the pasta to keep it from sticking.
2. While pasta cooks, in a skillet, brown the sausage. Remove sausage and set aside in a bowl.
3. Add butter to the skillet and saute zucchini and onion until zucchini is crisp tender (a little before al dente).
4. Add sausage back into the skillet with vegetables and add spices (if doing optional, reserve half of all spices for the pasta)
5. Add tomatoes, if desired. Stir well.
6. If doing optional, in the pot of pasta, add other half of spices to pasta, stir well.
7. In a large serving bowl, mix pasta and sausage mix together. Serve while hot.

[^sausage]: Polska Kielbasa also is good.

[^onion]: 2 Tbsp dried onion can work in a pinch, not recommended though.

[^tomatoes]: Rachel and Justin often don't use tomatoes with this dish.
