# Chicken Parmigiana

__Original Source__: Wassom Cookbook

__Servings per Recipe__:

__Description__: A quick way to make some Chicken Parm. Typically served over prepared spaghetti, it's a soft, juciy chicken wrapped in sauce, breading, and cheese. It cheats a little, but that time is well saved when you're trying to make a weeknight dinner.
