## Instructions

1. For crust, combine crushed graham crackers &amp; cinnamon. Stir in melted butter. (If desired, reserve &frac14; cup of the crumb mixture for topping.) Press the remaining crumb mixture onto the bottom &amp; 2 inches up the sides of an 8&quot; or 9&quot; springform pan.
2. For filling, in a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar, flour, and vanilla until combined. Add eggs &amp; egg yolk all at once, beating on low speed just until combined. Stir in milk.
3. Pour filling into crust. Place the cheesecake pan on a shallow baking pan in the oven. Bake in a 375&deg;F oven for 45-50 minutes for an 8&quot; pan (OR 35-40 minutes for the 9&quot; pan), or until center appears nearly set when shaken.
4. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Loosen the crust from sides, using a small spatula. Cool for 30 minutes more. Remove the sides of the pan. Cool cheesecake completely. Cover and chill at least 4 hours before serving.
