# Farris Stroganoff

__Original Source__: Farris Family Recipes

__Servings per Recipe__: 4

__Description__: This is something that I've enjoyed and like due to the simplicity of the recipe. Similar to [a Wassom Recipe](hamburger-rice-sauce.md) and [another Farris Recipe](creamy-beef-and-rice.md). I recommend the Farris Recipe.

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with water & set it on the stove, on high heat.
2. While you wait for it to boil, cook your hamburger in a separate skillet, on medium heat. Add diced onions, if you’d like.
3. Once the hamburger is fully cooked, add the cream of mushroom soup, &frac14; can of milk, and a small spoonful of sour cream.
4. Turn it to low & let it simmer/stay warm.
5. Once the water is boiling, add the egg noodles. Cook to desired tenderness. Drain, then add hamburger gravy to the noodles. ENJOY!
