## Instructions

2. In a large skillet or pot, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes until soft.

3. Stir in the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

4. Sprinkle in the flour and stir constantly for 1 minute to form a roux.

6. Stir in thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper.

7. Add the cooked chicken and frozen vegetables. Simmer for 4 to 5 minutes until heated through and tender.

8. Fold in the cooked pasta and stir until everything is well coated in the creamy sauce.
