# Chicken Crescents

__Original Source__: Wassom Family

__Servings per Recipe__: 16 per recipe

__Description__: A Wassom Family favorite! Dad Wassom requested this for many of his birthdays. Growing up, Rachel always thought these were "Chicken Croissants". But then this recipe said otherwise :joy:

## Ingredients

### Chicken Crescent

- 4-5 chicken breasts
- 8 oz cream cheese, softened
- 3 stalks celery, diced
- &frac12; onion, diced
- 1 Tbsp butter
- Salt and Pepper
- 4 tubes Crescent Rolls (think Pillsbury)

### Sauce

- 2 cans cream of chicken soup
- &frac14; - &frac12; c. milk

***

## Instructions

1. Brown the chicken in a large skillet.
2. Sauté celery and onion with butter in a small skillet.
3. Mix the cream cheese, cooked chicken, and vegetables together.
4. Prepare crescents by pinching together 2 sections to make a rectangle.
5. Place a spoonful of the chicken mixture on each crescent and fold over, pressing down to seal. (It will look like a pillow.)
6. Bake for 20-25 minutes at 350&deg;F. [^footnotes]
7. Make the sauce by heating cream of chicken soup; pour enough milk until it reaches a gravy consistency.
8. After the chicken pillows have been baked, pour the sauce over them when serving.

[^footnotes]: While the original recipe says 25-30 minutes, we need to adjust due to altitude. The recipe was created in Texas, closer to sea level at 630'. At the time of this writing, we're at 4,705', so a little higher :)
