## Ingredients

### Fish

- 4 tilapia or catfish fillets (6–8 oz each)
- Salt & pepper
- Cajun seasoning (&frac12;–1 tsp per fillet)
- Olive oil (for pan‑frying)

### Sauce / “Stuffing” Topping

- 4 oz lump crab meat
- ½ cup peeled, deveined shrimp (roughly chopped)
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1/4 cup finely chopped onion
- 1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- ½ cup cream
- ¼ tsp paprika
- A pinch of cayenne (optional, for heat)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: 1 tbsp lemon juice or chopped parsley

## Instructions

1. __Season & pan-fry the fish__

    Pat the fillets dry. Season both sides with salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each fillet about 3–4 minutes per side until firm and golden. Remove and keep warm.

2. __Prepare the topping__

    In the same skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic; sauté until soft and fragrant (~2–3 min). Stir in shrimp and cook briefly until pink. Add crab meat, sauté just to warm through.

3. __Finish the sauce__

    Stir in cream, paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Heat gently until thickened but not separating. Add lemon or parsley, if using.

4. __Assemble the dish__

    Place each cooked fillet on a plate and spoon the creamy seafood topping over the fish. Serve hot.

## Serving Suggestions

Offer sides like dirty rice, steamed veggies, or garlic mashed potatoes to round out the meal.

A light garnish of chopped parsley or a squeeze of lemon brightens the flavor.

### Notes

- I pre-roasted the bell pepper
- I just served it with rice (cooked in chicken broth) - I’ll see how dirty rice tastes with it too
- works great with salmon too!
- Lump Crab is so expensive. I actually used imitation crab and it still tastes delicious!
