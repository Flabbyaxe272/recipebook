## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375&deg;F. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with non-stick spray.
2. Cut chicken breasts into one inch pieces. Lay out evenly in the bottom of prepared dish. Season with pepper (already gets a lot of salt).
3. In a medium bowl whisk together the condensed soups and milk. Pour mixture evenly over chicken.
4. Sprinkle dry stuffing mix evenly over the top. Pour chicken broth over the stuffing mix, making sure to get as much of it covered as possible.
5. Cover dish with foil and bake 40 to 45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.
6. Remove from oven and let stand 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!

## Notes

When pouring the broth on the stuffing, be conservative at first, and then work through again to ensure maximum coverage.

It is very high in sodium, so be cautious if you have high blood pressure!
