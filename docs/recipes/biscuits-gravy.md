## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F. In a mixer, stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, cream of tartar, and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 5 minutes in the mixer. Make a well in the center. Add milk all at once; stir with a padle by hand until moistened.
2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Quickly knew dough by gently folding and pressing dough 10 to 12 strokes or until nearly smooth. Pat or lightly roll dough to &frac12;-inch thickness. Cut dough with a floured 2&frac12;-inch biscuit cutter (Or a floured cup works too).
3. Place biscuits 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden. Remove biscuits from baking sheet and serve hot.
4. While biscuits are baking, brown sausage in a pan. Add butter, let it melt. Add flour by sprinkling over the pan, careful not to let it clump up too much. Mix until absorbed by the butter. Pour milk into pan, and cook until thickened. Add salt and pepper to taste.
