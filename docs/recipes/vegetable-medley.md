__Servings per Recipe__: 10

__Description__:
"This is one of our family staples for Thanksgiving." Rachel and I love it, and when we introduced it to the Farris family during Thanksgiving 2022, it was instantly a favorite. I think it's because of how unhealthy it is haha.

## Ingredients

- &frac12; - 1 head Cauliflower
- 2 heads Broccoli
- 5 Carrots
- &frac12; lg Onion
- &frac14; c. Butter
- 8 oz Velveeta Cheese[^cheese]
- 1 can Cream of Mushroom
- French Fried Onions

***

## Instructions

1. Wash, chop, and steam cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, and onion.[^steam]
2. Melt butter, Velveeta, and soup together until smooth.[^melting]
3. Mix drained vegetables with cheese mixture and lay in 9"&times;13" baking dish.
4. Sprinkle french fried onions on top
5. Bake at 350&deg;F for 15-20 minutes.[^time]

[^cheese]: It needs to be Velveeta. No other processed cheese ends up having the consistency as Velveeta does.
[^steam]: Momma Wassom steamed them in the microwave for 5 minutes - not completely done. This was intentional as you cook them more in the oven.
[^melting]: Momma Wassom put the mixture in the microwave 2 minutes, stirred, then 1 minute at a time, stirring in between.
[^time]: While the original recipe says 20-25 minutes, we need to adjust due to altitude. The recipe was created in Texas, closer to sea level at 630'. At the time of this writing, we're at 4,705', so a little higher :)
