# Creamy Beef and Rice Skillet

__Original Source__: [Hamburger, Rice and Sauce by Wassom Family](hamburger-rice-sauce.md)

__Servings per Recipe__: 4 servings

__Description__: Tried and improved recipe to add more depth and flavor for the recipe. This will give it umami depth, acid balance, and more aromatic flavor than [the original](hamburger-rice-sauce.md). This can and should be doubled.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef
- 2 cups cooked rice
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can cream of mushroom soup (10.5 oz)
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1-2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- &frac12;-1 tsp beef bouillon paste or powder
- &frac14; tsp fish sauce (optional but ideal)
- &frac12; tsp black pepper

- Salt only if needed
- Optional: &frac12; tsp smoked paprika or &frac12; tsp dried thyme

## Instructions

1. Brown the beef on medium-high. Don’t stir constantly; let it sit so a deep brown crust forms. Drain only if necessary.
2. Add the diced onion. Cook until softened and lightly browned.
3. Add garlic; cook 30-45 seconds.
4. Add the cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, Worcestershire, bouillon, fish sauce (if using), pepper, and onion powder. Stir until smooth.
5. Add soy sauce in small increments. Stop as soon as it tastes balanced; ignore color.
6. Taste and add a pinch of salt if needed.
7. Optional: Add smoked paprika or dried thyme for extra depth.
8. Fold in the cooked rice, ensuring every grain is coated.
9. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes
