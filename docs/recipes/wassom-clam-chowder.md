# Clam Chowder

__Original Source__: Grandma JB (JoAnn Madsen)

__Servings per Recipe__: 20 servings (1 cup servings)

__Description__: Great Clam Chowder recipe. Light, creamy, delicious flavors. I personally recommend a half recipe of this. Otherwise, you'll end up makeing a gallon of soup.

## Ingredients

### Chowder

- 5 lbs potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 lb carrots, peeled and sliced
- 5-7 stalks celery, chopped
- 1 lb bacon, cooked and chopped
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
- 2 cans minced clams, drained
- 1 c. half & half (cream)

### White Sauce (Roux)

- 3 Tbsp flour
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 2 c. milk

## Instructions

1. Add 2 inches of salt water in large cooking pot, and then put all vegetables in
2. Bring to boil, and then put on simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Add bacon and salt and pepper to taste
4. Add White Sauce (Roux) (See [below](#making-white-sauce-roux-instructions) for roux Instructions)
5. After adding white sauce, add clams and half & half. Stir and let simmer for 15 minutes for flavor to enhance.

### Making White Sauce (Roux Instructions)

1. Melt butter in pan. Add flour and stir. Bring heat to low
2. Add milk slowly, whisking as you go to remove lumps of flour.
3. The roux will thicken as it heats up. When it's of a gravy consistency, pour into the pot of soup.
