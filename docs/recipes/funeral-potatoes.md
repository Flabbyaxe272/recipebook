# Funeral Potatoes

__Original Source__:

__Servings per Recipe__:

__Description__: A Farris Family favorite, always paired with some good meat smoked from Dad's ugly smoker. Not that it was ugly, but that's what it's called, an "ugly smoker". Anyways, also seen at the Thanksgiving dinner table.

## Ingredients

- 64 oz bag of frozen shredded hash browns (or cubed)
- 2 (10 &frac34; oz) cans Cream of Chicken soup
- 2 cups sour cream
- 1 &frac12; cups grated, sharp cheddar cheese
- &frac12; cup melted butter
- &frac12; cup chopped onion
- 2 cups finely crushed Corn Flakes
- 2 Tbsp butter, melted

### Optional

- A chunk of smoked cheddar cheese[^cheese]
- Spicy cheese[^cheese]

## Instructions

1. Grease 9x13 baking dish. Preheat oven to 350*.
2. In a large bowl, combine soup, sour cream, cheese, onions, and the ½ cup of melted butter. Gently fold hash browns into mixture. Pour mixture into pan.
3. Combine crushed Corn Flakes and the 2 Tbsp butter, then sprinkle it on top of the potato mixture.[^skip]
4. Bake for 30 minutes (unless using the cubed potatoes, then bake for 55 minutes).

[^skip]: I usually skip the butter here and just loosely sprinkle the crushed corn flakes on top. There’s usually enough butter to keep them crispy.

[^cheese]: Varies on intensity of smokiness. Dad always smoked his own cheeses in his smoker. He usually has a chunk about the size of a stick of butter.
