# Funeral Potatoes

__Alternate Names__: Hashbrown and Cheese Casserole

__Original Source__: Farris family

__Servings per Recipe__: 8 servings

__Description__: A Farris Family favorite, always paired with some good meat smoked from Dad's ugly smoker. Not that it was ugly, but that's what it's called, an "ugly smoker". Anyways, also seen at the Thanksgiving dinner table. Also, a Wassom family favorite. Other sources vary in ingredient amount, but I'm biased for this one. :sweat_smile:

## Ingredients

- 64 oz bag of frozen shredded hash browns (or cubed)
- 2 (10 &frac34; oz) cans cream of chicken soup
- 16 oz sour cream
- 8 oz grated, sharp cheddar cheese
- &frac12; c. butter, melted (add 1 tsp of salt if unsalted butter)
- &frac12; c. chopped white onion
- 2 c. finely crushed Corn Flakes

### Optional

- 2 Tbsp butter, melted[^butter]
- A chunk of smoked cheddar cheese[^cheese]
- Spicy cheese[^cheese]
- &frac12; tsp garlic powder[^garlic]

## Instructions

1. Grease 9x13 baking dish. Preheat oven to 350*.
2. In a large bowl, combine soup, sour cream, cheese, onions, and the &frac12; c. of melted butter. Gently fold hash browns into mixture. Pour mixture into pan.
3. Sprinkle corn flakes on top of the potato mixture.[^butter]
4. Bake for 30 minutes (unless using the cubed potatoes, then bake for 55 minutes).

[^butter]: I usually skip the additional butter here and just loosely sprinkle the crushed corn flakes on top. There’s usually enough butter to keep them crispy. Otherwise, combine cornflakes and butter.
[^cheese]: Varies on intensity of smokiness. Dad always smoked his own cheeses in his smoker. He usually has a chunk about the size of a stick of butter.
[^garlic]: As recommended on [An Organized Chaos](https://anorganizedchaos.com/hashbrown-and-cheese-casserole).
