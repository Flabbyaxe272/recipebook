## Instructions

1. In stock pot, over medium heat, cook beef, onion and garlic until beef is no longer pink, stirring occasionally to break up meat. Drain until about 1 Tbsp fat remains.
2. After beef is browned, add tomato paste. Keep on medium heat and stir occasionally for 1-2 minutes, until color becomes brick-red.
3. Add Worcestershire sauce, stir quickly and let it sizzle for 15-30 seconds.
4. Add all other ingredients, i.e. green pepper, beans, salsa, tomato sauce, petite diced tomatoes, and seasonings. Caution on the cayenne, a little can go a long way. Stir throughly.
5. Cover; simmer 30+ mins, stirring occasionally. The longer the simmer, the more layered the flavors become. Most chefs recommend 2-3 hours. Serve with toppings as preferred.

[^salsa]: Can be homemade. Recipe recommends a jar of thick and chinky salsa. Recipe originally calls for a full jar (16 oz). I found that can thin out the chili a little. If making homemade, ensure to make thick and chunky, and don't add water at all or something crazy like that.

[^chipotle]: If you don't have chipotle chili powder, just replace with normal chili powder, totaling 1 Tbsp chili powder per recipe.
