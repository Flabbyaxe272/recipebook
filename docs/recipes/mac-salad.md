# Hawaiian Mac Salad

__Original Source__: ChatGPT

__Servings per Recipe__: 8 servings

## Ingredients

- 1 lb elbow macaroni
- 2 c. Best Foods or Hellmann’s mayonnaise (not Miracle Whip)
- ¼ c. whole milk (or more for creaminess)
- 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (or white vinegar)
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper (adjust to taste)
- 1 c. grated carrot (about 1–2 carrots)
- ½ c. grated yellow or sweet onion (optional)
- ¼ c. chopped celery or green onion (optional for variety — not always traditional)

## Instructions

1. __Boil the macaroni__
    - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
    - Add macaroni and cook it 2–3 minutes past al dente — very soft, not mushy but tender. This helps it soak in the dressing.
    - Drain and immediately toss with vinegar while still warm. Let it cool for 10–15 minutes.

2. __Make the dressing__
    - In a large bowl, mix mayo, milk, sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir until smooth and creamy.

3. __Mix it all together__
    - Add the grated carrots (and onions if using) to the macaroni.
    - Fold in the dressing — add it all, even if it seems like too much. The pasta will absorb it.
    - Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

4. __Chill and set__
    - Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight. It gets better the next day.
    - If it dries out, stir in a splash of milk or more mayo before serving.

## Tips

- Don’t skimp on mayo. Hawaiian mac salad is known for being ultra creamy.
- No mustard, pickles, or eggs. Keep it simple — that’s what makes it Hawaiian.
- Serve cold, as a side to meats or part of a plate lunch.
