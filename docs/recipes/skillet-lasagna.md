## Ingredients

- 1 &frac14; c. (6 oz) plus &frac34; c. (3 oz) whole-milk mozzarella, shredded
- 1 c. whole-milk ricotta
- &frac13; c.  plus &frac13; c. fresh basil, chopped
- &frac14; c. (&frac34; oz) Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated (Parmesan cheese)

## Instructions

1. Mix 1&frac14; cups mozzarella, the ricotta, &frac13; cup basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, oregano, &frac12; teaspoon salt, and &frac12; teaspoon pepper in a bowl until combined.

2. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and &frac12; teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring frequently to break the beef into smaller pieces, until the meat is browned, 7 to 9 minutes.

3. Put the marinara sauce, 2 cups water, and broken noodles in a bowl. Mix until the noodles are thoroughly coated with the sauce, then add them to the skillet and stir.

4. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender, 25 to 30 minutes.

5. Spoon dollops of the cheese mixture on top of the noodles and sprinkle with the remaining ¾ cup mozzarella. Cover and continue to cook until heated through and the cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes more.

6. Let sit for 15 minutes before serving, garnished with the remaining &frac13; cup basil.
