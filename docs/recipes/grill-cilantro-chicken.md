## Ingredients

- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1/4 c. lime juice, freshly-squeezed
- 1/2 c. honey
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
- 1/2 c. cilantro, chopped
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper

## Instructions

1. Slice chicken into even 1-inch cubes. Place chicken in a gallon-sized storage bag.
2. Place remaining ingredients in a medium bowl and whisk to combine.
3. Separate 1/4 cup of marinade and place in a small bowl. Store in fridge until cook time.
4. Place marinade in storage bag with chicken and seal tightly. Shake chicken around to coat completely.
5. Place bag on a plate or baking dish to catch any leaks. Place chicken in fridge to marinate for at least 3 hours or up to 8 hours.
6. 30 minutes before cook time, soak your medium wooden skewers in water for 20 minutes to prevent them from catching fire during grilling. Remove from water and place on paper towel to dry slightly before skewing.
7. Remove chicken from fridge. Grab 1 skewer and place 3-4 pieces of chicken on skewer, leaving about 1 inch of free space on both ends of skewer. Repeat with remaining chicken.
8. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Place all skewers on grill.
9. After 3 minutes, spread remaining marinade on chicken and then flip so it can finish cooking. Do NOT brush marinade on cooked side to avoid contamination.
10. Grill for another 3 minutes, or until chicken is done.
