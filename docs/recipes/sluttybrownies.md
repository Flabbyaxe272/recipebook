7. Top brownie batter with white chocolate chips.
8. Crush remaining Oreos into large pieces. Evenly pour on top.
9. Bake, uncovered for 50 minutes[^cooktime] or until they pass the toothpick test.
10. remove from the oven and allow to cool.
11. Pull the brownies out of the pan by aluminum foil/parchment paper from step one. Drizzle with caramel sauce and sprinkle with fleur de sel.
12. Cut into 16 squares and enjoy! They're supposed to be gooey so you may need a fork!

[^cooktime]: The original recipe says 35-40 minutes, but it usually undercooks the recipe.
