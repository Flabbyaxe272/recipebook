__Original Source__: Better Homes & Gardens (1996)

## Ingredients

### Apple Biscuits

- 1 &frac34; c. all purpose flour
- &frac14; c. wheat bran[^bran]
- 2 Tbsp white sugar
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- &frac12; tsp ground cinnamon
- &frac14; tsp salt
- &frac12; c. butter[^butter]
- &frac23; c. milk
- &frac12; c. fresh green apple bits[^fruit]

[^bran]: If you don't have wheat bran, you can substiute it by adding more flour, just the same amount. It should total to 2 c. flour.
[^butter]: Butter needs to be as cold as it can be without being frozen, so pull the butter out of the fridge at the last possible second. (Tip from Dad)
[^fruit]: The original recipe calls for &frac12; c. dried fruit bits. Substituted the dried for fresh and never looked back.

### Tang Sauce

- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 Tbsp Tang (powdered orange juice)
- 2 c. powdered sugar
- 3 Tbsp milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F. Combine flour, bran, white sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Cut in the butter. Make a well in the center of dry mixture. Add the milk and apple bits, together; stir until just moistened.
2. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Quickly knead dough 10 to 12 strokes or until nearly smooth. Pat or lightly roll dough to &frac12;-inch thickness. Cut dough with a floured 2&frac12;-inch biscuit cutter. (Or be like Dad and use a floured cup rim)
3. Place biscuits 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden. Remove biscuits from baking sheet and cool slightly on wire rack.
4. For Tang Sauce, mix all ingredients until done.
