## Instructions

1. Put warm water into a mixing bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Set aside.  
2. In another bowl, blend the warm milk, sugar, shortening, and salt. Cool until lukewarm, then add eggs, the yeast mixture, and the orange juice. Stir in flour, a few cups at a time, to make a soft dough. Let stand for 10 minutes.  
3. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes. Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and set in a warm place. Let the dough rise for 2 hours, or until doubled in size. Punch down and let sit for another 10 minutes.  
4. Roll the dough out on a floured surface into a rectangle about ½ inch thick. Cut the dough into strips ½ inch wide and 14 inches long.  
5. Take one strip and cut it into ½-inch-long pieces, rolling each piece into a ball. Roll the remaining strips into rounded snake shapes.  
6. One at a time, place a long snake piece on a greased cookie sheet. Place one end of the strip over the other end to make a loop. Bring the end that’s underneath up and across to the other end. Place one of the dough balls on top of the bottom loop.  
7. Cover the bunnies and let them rise in a warm place for 45-60 minutes, until they double in size.  
8. Bake at 375°F for 12-15 minutes.  
9. While Bunnies bake, stir powdered sugar, water & butter together. Frost the bunnies with glaze while they are still warm. ENJOY!
