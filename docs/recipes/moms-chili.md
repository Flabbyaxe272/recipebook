# Mom's Chili

__Original Source__: Grandma Eula Hanson

__Servings per Recipe__: ??

__Description__: I know Mom made this often and Dad made a variation that's really spicy for Chili cookoffs by adding Ghost pepper seasoning and letting it just simmer for 12 hours. The recipe has been edited to adjust for what is actually used as of late.
