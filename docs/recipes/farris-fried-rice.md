__Description__: Simple recipe, great flavor! Adjust to your preferences. Justin doesn't add peas to the fried rice, adds some diced pork, and uses a dash of sesame oil to add a twist of flavor towards the end.

## Ingredients

- 2-3 cups cooked rice[^rice]
- 2 Tbsp oil
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- Diced green onions
- Diced carrots
- Peas
- Soy sauce

[^rice]: The key to the rice is that you cook it the night prior, at the very latest, and refridgerate it. You usually want one day old rice. That makes it not sticky or mushy when cooking in the pan.

## Instructions

1. In a large fry pan, heat oil and brown garlic.
2. Add rice and diced green onions.
3. Make space in the pan and scramble eggs.
4. Mix egg with rice and add diced carrots and peas.
5. Add soy sauce to taste. Start lightly, but then add more as needed. If your rice is brown at the end, it's too much.
