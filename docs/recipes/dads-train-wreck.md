# Dad's Train Wreck

__Original Source__: Dad (Keith) Farris

__Servings per Recipe__: 6

__Description__: This came about because my parents liked to make breakfast burritos a lot. My dad loved to cook while camping and it just became a thing. He doesn't write recipes so my Mom had to write out an idea of what he uses. I've adjusted according to how I remember it. Adjust to your liking accordingly. It's never made the same twice.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb shredded hashbrowns
- 4 Tbsp butter
- 1 lb bacon
- 1 lb breakfast Sausage[^sausage]
- &frac12; lg Onion
- 6 Eggs
- Cheese
- Salt/pepper

[^sausage]: Original recipie calls for Jimmy Dean brand, NOT Maple flavored. Maple flavoring makes it all taste like syrup. But if you don't have Jimmy Dean, then any pork breakfast sausage should do.
