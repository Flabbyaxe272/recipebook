# Chicken, Broccoli, and Rice Casserole

__Original Source__:

__Servings per Recipe__: 8 servings

__Description__: A Farris family staple; it's been a wonderful dinner to make and have as leftovers for the week to come. For a family of 8, it was a lifesaver to make once and have everyone eat it without cooking 3 different meals for dinner. For a family of 2, it's a great way to meal prep for the coming week.

## Ingredients

- 2 c. cooked rice
- 1 c. broccoli[^broccoli]
- 2 chicken breasts, cubed
- &frac18; c. butter
- &frac12; c. onion, chopped
- 2 cans cream of chicken
- 1 can milk
- 1 c. cheddar cheese[^cheese]
- 1 pkg saltine crackers

[^cheese]: Mild, medium, sharp, or extra sharp cheddar works, but sharp is the best.

[^broccoli]: Steaming beforehand is the best, with fresh broccoli. But frozen will work just as well.
