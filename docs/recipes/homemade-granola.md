## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Have a 15x10 rimmed baking sheet ready.
2. Combine the oil and honey in a saucepan over low heat. Stir until combined. Whisk in the vanilla. Remove from the heat and set aside.
3. In a bowl, combine the oats, almonds, brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Mix well. Pour the honey mixture evenly over the oat mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until everything is coated.
4. Spread the granola out in an even layer on the baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake at 300 degrees F for 40 minutes, stirring gently every 10 minutes.
5. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the granola cool completely on the baking sheet.
6. Combine the cooled granola with the dried fruit (and chocolate chips, if using). Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 1 week at room temperature (or freeze for up to 3 months).

## FAQs

### Can I use other nuts or dried fruit?

Just make sure to keep the amounts in the same ratio. For example, if you use other dried fruit, chop it up to equal the same amount called for of raisins.

### Is homemade granola cheaper than store bought?

Buying the ingredients in larger or bulk packaging will definitely make this cheaper per ounce than buying it in the store. However, in some cases it may be cheaper to buy a small package of granola than making it at home. This recipe is addicting so we're pretty sure you'll want to make it a lot!

### Can I use other oil than vegetable oil?

Yes, you can use other oils. Many people prefer to use coconut oil or avocado oil instead.

### I can't have honey, what else can I use in this recipe?

If you are allowed to have molasses, maple syrup, or agave, any of those should work.
