## Ingredients

- Moms pizza dough recipe.

## Instructions

1. Roll out the dough for your cast iron. Line the bottom.
2. Sauce, cheese, meat, layer until you're happy. We used about 1lb of mozzarella.
3. Cover with remaining dough. Brush with butter and garlic seasoning and more cheese.
4. Bake at 375 for about 45min. Let sit for 15 min after baking so it cools enough to not pour out all over.
5. Then eat it up!!
