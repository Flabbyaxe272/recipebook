This is an online collection of recipes that is meant to be shared within the Farris Family and friends!

We find things from the internet or family recipes, and we put them as a collection here for ease of use.

Use the Recipes tab to browse, or search your favorites to get to them instantly!

This is really helpful if you're cooking, and you don't have the counterspace for a recipe book.

If you have suggestions on what you would like to see in this recipe book, please add an item in the Todoist board.

Please refer to the [About](about.md) page if you don't know if you have access to the Todoist board.
