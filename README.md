# Farris Family Recipe Book

A personal project that involves adding all the recipes that I can get my hands on and make it available to everyone's phone.

Think about it: how often have you run out of counterspace in the kitchen because a big book with 100 other recipes fill up about 1/3 of your counters? Now, you can get a magnetic mount or stand and conveiently place your phone wherever!

Additonal bonus:

- **No Ads!** I'm committed to running this ad-free, because who wants to see ads relating to deodorant when you're trying to cook up some family recipes?

- **Easy to follow!** All the recipes I use follow the same template: Ingredients, then instructions! Notes are included either as footnotes or it's own section. No ranting to make someone scroll all the way down to get to the good stuff.

## Roadmap

I'm still learning so I don't know how this project will go. But if it does start taking off, I want to start tracking progress of features in the Projects section. 

## Contributing

I use a python venv that I use to run it locally. I used to use [squidfunk's docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/squidfunk/mkdocs-material), but ran into issues when I started using Fedora 42. I'll most likely learn how Fedora works, and get it running in a docker again, but that's what happened.

If you want to get started, you can follow the directions from the documentation [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/), or you can see what I do below.

Keep in mind, I'm very much a beginner, and am, by no means, an expert in python, shell scripting, or how to develop a website. But I am here trying my best out.
